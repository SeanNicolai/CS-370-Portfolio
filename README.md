# CS-370-Portfolio

#### Initial Setup and Contributions
The project's theme is a popular treasure hunt game, where the challenge was to develop an intelligent agent for the pirate to find the optimal path to the treasure using deep Q-learning. The initial codebase provided two Python classes (`TreasureMaze.py` for the environment and `GameExperience.py` for storing game episodes) along with a notebook containing a skeletal implementation of deep Q-learning marked by #TODO headers. I was responsible for completing the deep Q-learning implementation within the notebook, ensuring that the pirate could learn effectively from its environment through both exploration and exploitation.

### Connections to Computer Science

**Role of Computer Scientists:**
This project exemplifies the role of computer scientists in building intelligent systems that can learn and adapt to their environments. Through the application of machine learning techniques, specifically reinforcement learning, we can create models that simulate decision-making processes and optimize performance based on data-driven insights.

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
As a computer scientist, my approach to solving the challenge involved breaking down the problem into manageable componentsâ€”understanding the environment setup, the agent's learning mechanism, and how the agent interacts with the environment. By iteratively refining the model's parameters and the learning algorithm, I aligned the agent's learning process with the desired outcomes.

**Ethical Responsibilities:**
While this project is a simulation, it reflects the broader ethical responsibilities of transparency, accuracy, and reliability in machine learning applications. Ensuring that the model behaves as expected and reliably replicates the learning and decision-making process without unintended consequences is crucial. This involves thorough testing and validation to avoid biases in how the model interprets its environment.

### Reflections on Learning

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of how theoretical knowledge in neural networks and reinforcement learning is applied in practice. The hands-on experience helped me appreciate the complexities involved in tuning models to achieve desired behaviors and the importance of meticulous parameter adjustment and scenario testing. Additionally, documenting my learning process and reflecting on it through this README helps in consolidating my understanding and sharing my insights effectively.
